# **Model Card**

The Animal Emotion Classifier is an image classification AI model designed to recognize emotions in animals to better help human understanding of animals.
Potential applications of this model range everywhere from fun mobile apps to use for your pets, to assiting caretakers in better understanding the emotional
states of animals to providing appropriate care and support.

# **Intended use:**
The Animal Emotion Classifier is not intended for professional use. It is intended to be used as a fun tool for humans to better understand the emotions of animals.

# **Training Data:**
Dataset Source: Pet's Facial Expression Image Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/pets-facial-expression-dataset)
Data Augmentation: Tensorflow RandomFlip, RandomRotation, RandomZoom
Augmented Data Size: 2728 images
Image Shape: [128, 128, 3]
