# CMU Pre-College AI Scholars Final Project
# PawSpective

Welcome to PawSpective! This is a final project for Carnegie Mellon University's AI Scholars program. We were given 15 hours project time to create an image classification model to provide a solution to some problem in the world. Using computer vision and image classficiation, we made a model that can accurately predict animal emotion, bridging the gap between human and animal communication.

# Introduction
PawSpective is an AI tool to help understand the emotions of common household animals. Using state of the art Convolutional Neural Networks and deep learning techniques, we can accurately predict an animal's emotion. By using pre-labeled data, our model was trained on various emotional states such as happiness, anger, and sadness, on a variety of animals such as cats, dogs, turtles, horses, and more.

# Features
*High-accuracy image classification for animal emotions.
*Easy-to-use website interface for testing the model on custom images.
*Support for multiple animal species.
*Scalable and extensible codebase for future improvements.
